  title: Beneath a Floating Obelisk
  description: >
    Soaring approximately two stories high and dominating the center of the area is a massive, floating obelisk. No observable method keeps it afloat, yet it hovers endlessly. The surface of the obelisk is polished obsidian, returning barely discernible reflections of its surroundings. The obelisk is covered in faintly glowing runes that dim and brighten rhythmically. Above the obelisk, though difficult to see from this vantage point, is a peaked ceiling. Underfoot, stone brick pavers cover the floor. Peculiarly there are a small number of obsidian bricks interspersed throughout the stone pavers. Even more peculiarly, these obsidian bricks emit magical light throughout the area. From here, hallways lead to the north and south while the great hall expands to the east and the west.

  description: >
    High-vaulted and peaked ceilings, barely detectable from the floor, loom above. From this vantage point, they seem nearly as non-descript as the stone walls, which are completely devoid of everything. There are no mars, scrapes, damages, decorations; they are lifeless. The floor, however, does contain a peculiarity. It is crafted mostly from ordinary stone pavers but the occasional obsidian brick is littered into the design. Each of these obsidian bricks casts a magical glow through the area, providing ample light. From here, the hallway leads south into a large central chamber with a massive obelisk. It also leads into three smaller rooms to the north, northeast, and northwest.

  description: >
    The walls of this circular chamber are ordinary stone bricks. The walls extend approximately two stories high before being capped off by a rounded stone ceiling. In addition to the walls and the ceiling, the floor is also made of the same grey stone bricks. Interestingly, interspersed throughout the stone bricks on the floor is the occasional obsidian brick. Even more interestingly, each of these obsidian bricks casts a magical glow about the chamber. Dominating the center of the room is a floating orb. The orb glows a soft light bluish color and seems to be slowly, but constantly, materializing and immaterializing. # Down the road, this orb will serve as a teleportation device. For now, it is dormant.

    In the center of this room, mounted atop an elaborate pedestal, is a red crystal. The crystal gives off a bit of red light and emits a constant, albeit quiet, humming sound. The pedestal it is mounted on was fashioned entirely from electrum and has several jewels set in it. Beneath the pedestal is an almost ordinary floor made of stone bricks. In certain places, the stone brick pavers have been replaced with an obsidian one. Each of the obsidian pavers radiates a magical light that illuminates the area. The walls and ceiling of the room are made of the same grey ordinary stones as found underfoot.

The pedestal it rests upon was crafted from electrum and has several jewels set in it. Despite the grandiose appearance of the pedestal and the crystal atop it, the rest of the room is fairly ordinary. Undecorated and unmarred, rather boring to be exact, stone floors, walls, and ceilings outfit the rest of this triangular chamber. Of note; however, are the seemingly randomly placed obsidian brick pavers in the floor. Each of the obsidian bricks glows with a magical light aiding in lighting the chamber.

On the northern and western ends of this part of the grand hall, the floors meet with the stone walls which soar approximately two stories high before meeting the vaulted ceilings above.

    Grey stone pavers, as ordinary as is possible, cover the ground here. Laid from east to the west, they are unmarred; however, the occasional stone paver has been replaced by an obsidian paver. The purpose of the obsidian pavers is very clear, as each of them provides magical illumination into this area of the grand hall. At the southern and western ends of the room, the stone pavers meet with walls that are strikingly similar to the floors. These walls rise approximately two stories high before meeting with the vaulted ceiling above. Forming a U-shape in the area are several shelves, racks, display cases, and other types of furniture merchants use to peddle their wares. The U-shape opens at the northern end to lead back into the great, and is the only exit from this part of the hall. While passage easy may be blocked, sight is not, and it can be easily discerned that there are more market stalls to the east of here. # all of the rooms in this building will eventually have merchants on a rotational basis.
