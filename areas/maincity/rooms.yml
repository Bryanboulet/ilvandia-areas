  title: Beneath a Floating Obelisk
  description: >
    Soaring approximately two stories high and dominating the center of the area is a massive, floating obelisk. No observable method keeps it afloat, yet it hovers endlessly. The surface of the obelisk is polished obsidian, returning barely discernible reflections of its surroundings. The obelisk is covered in faintly glowing runes that dim and brighten rhythmically. Above the obelisk, though difficult to see from this vantage point, is a peaked ceiling. Underfoot, stone brick pavers cover the floor. Peculiarly there are a small number of obsidian bricks interspersed throughout the stone pavers. Even more peculiarly, these obsidian bricks emit magical light throughout the area. From here, hallways lead to the north and south while the great hall expands to the east and the west.

  title: A Stone Brick Hallway
  description: >
    High-vaulted and peaked ceilings, barely detectable from the floor, loom above. From this vantage point, they seem nearly as non-descript as the stone walls, which are completely devoid of everything. There are no mars, scrapes, damages, decorations; they are lifeless. The floor, however, does contain a peculiarity. It is crafted mostly from ordinary stone pavers but the occasional obsidian brick is littered into the design. Each of these obsidian bricks casts a magical glow through the area, providing ample light. From here, the hallway leads south into a large central chamber with a massive obelisk. It also leads into three smaller rooms to the north, northeast, and northwest.

    The walls of this circular chamber are ordinary stone bricks. The walls extend approximately two stories high before being capped off by a rounded stone ceiling. In addition to the walls and the ceiling, the floor is also made of the same grey stone bricks. Interestingly, interspersed throughout the stone bricks on the floor is the occasional obsidian brick. Even more interestingly, each of these obsidian bricks casts a magical glow about the chamber. Dominating the center of the room is a floating orb. The orb glows a soft light bluish color and seems to be slowly, but constantly, materializing and immaterializing. # Down the road, this orb will serve as a teleportation device. For now, it is dormant.

    In the center of this room, mounted atop an elaborate pedestal, is a red crystal. The crystal gives off a bit of red light and emits a constant, albeit quiet, humming sound. The pedestal it is mounted on was fashioned entirely from electrum and has several jewels set in it. Beneath the pedestal is an almost ordinary floor made of stone bricks. In certain places, the stone brick pavers have been replaced with an obsidian one. Each of the obsidian pavers radiates a magical light that illuminates the area. The walls and ceiling of the room are made of the same grey ordinary stones as found underfoot.

    Demanding attention in the middle of the room is a green crystal mounted atop an elaborate pedestal. The crystal hums quietly and glows softly. The pedestal it rests upon was crafted from electrum and has several jewels set in it. Despite the grandiose appearance of the pedestal and the crystal atop it, the rest of the room is fairly ordinary. Undecorated and unmarred, rather boring to be exact, stone floors, walls, and ceilings outfit the rest of this triangular chamber. Of note; however, are the seemingly randomly placed obsidian brick pavers in the floor. Each of the obsidian bricks glows with a magical light aiding in lighting the chamber.

    Stone brick pavers, arranged neatly, cover the ground. Interspersed throughout the stone brick pavers is the occasional obsidian brick paver. The obsidian brick pavers all cast a magical light on the area. Since the light comes so low from the ground, it's interesting to see the strange tricks it plays with shadows in the area. To the north and south of here are a couple of trade stalls. West of here the great hall continues and to the east a massive obelisk looms over the great hall.

  title: A Wide Dirt Road
  description: >
    A wide dirt road, intended as a primary route for trade based upon its width, runs north and south here. On the western side of the road is a large, two-story stone building. Along the east is a building of wood and stone. At the north, the dirt road meets with a road made of stone pavers.

  coordinates: [6, 0, 0]
  description: >
    Looming to the west is a massive, two-story stone brick building with an arched roof. Set in the wall is a large double wooden doorframe, the doors that belong to it are inexplicably missing. Along the northern end of the street are a couple of non-descript buildings of wood and stone brick. At the southern end of the street, the stone paver road meets with a wide dirt road. The stone street travels eastward.

  title: A Small Private Garden
  coordinates: [1, -4, 0]
  description: >
    A wide assortment of fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices are growing in this small garden. Nearly every bit of space available is home to a plant of some sort, with very little room for even moving around. The eastern and northern sides of this garden is bordered by a two-story building made of stone bricks and wood. The southern and western sides of this garden is closed off by a wooden privacy fence, about the height of a man and a half. The only exit from this garden is north into the building.
  npcs: # None, maybe a gardener or something
  items: # Plants and stuff will go in here. All kinds of them that can be picked and pruned and gathered.

  description: >
    This is an example of a room with a door. You always place the door in the room that you want to block
    access to. For instance, I want to block access to this room from room2, so I place this door on this room
    instead of room2. Now someone coming from room2 will have a door to deal with.
